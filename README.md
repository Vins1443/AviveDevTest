# Avive Backend Developer Test
## Installation
Create a virtualenv and install the requirements.txt file

```$ pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Instructions
This is a toy application that serves TODO lists.

Run `pytest` and you will see that there are several failing tests in the test suite either due to 
bugs or non-existent features.  You will have one hour to make as many tests pass as possible.

DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE TESTS!  The purpose of each test should be clear, if it is not, please ask for clarification.
